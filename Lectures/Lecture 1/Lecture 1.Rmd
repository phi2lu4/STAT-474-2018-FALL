# First definition of "Big Data"

- From Gartner's Marv Adrian in Q1, 2011 *Teradata magazine*:

*“Big data exceeds the reach of commonly used hardware environments and software tools to capture, manage, and process it within a tolerable elapsed time for its user population.” *

--

- From McKinsey Global Institute in May 2011:

*“Big data refers to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage and analyze.”*

- The power of big data is in the analysis you do and the actions you take. It is in neither the “big” part nor the “data” part
