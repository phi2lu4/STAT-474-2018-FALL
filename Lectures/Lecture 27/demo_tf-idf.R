# Task: Let's look at some classic physics texts from Project Gutenberg abd see what terms are important in these works, as measured by tf-idf. Letâ€™s download Discourse on Floating Bodies by Galileo Galilei, Treatise on Light by Christiaan Huygens, Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency by Nikola Tesla, and Relativity: The Special and General Theory by Albert Einstein.
