- It is easy

  - "20% of the tools work for 80% of text."

# Text in R

- All texts are in `string` format.

- Special characters can be included with the backslash. 

```{r}
x <- c("\"", "\\", "\'")
x
```


- Base R has many helper functions for string manipulation; however, it is not consistent.

  - `stringr` package (part of tidyverse)
  
  - All functions start with `str_`
  
  - *Question:* Which functions have we covered last Monday?
  
---
# Matching patterns with regular expressions

- Regular expression (Regexp) allows to describe patterns in strings.

  - Hard to learn but extremely useful.
  
  - `stringr` has the function `str_view()` and `str_view_all()` to show you how strings and patterns match.
  
--

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an")
```

--

```{r}
str_view(x, ".a.")
```

*Question:* What does the dot mean?

---
# Basic matches

- The dot (.) matches any character (except a newline)

- If you wish to match the character "." (dot), use an "escape" (i.e., the backslash)

```{r}
dot <- "\\."
cat(dot)
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\\.c")
```

- The regular expression as `\.` and the string that represent the regular expression as `"\\."`

- *Question:* Come up with the regexp string to match a literal ` \ `

--

- *Question:* What patterns will the regular expression `\..\..\..` match? How would you represent it as a string?

---
# Anchors

- By default, regular expression will match any part of a string.

- Use `^` to match the start of the string

- Use `$` to match the end of the string

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")
str_view(x, "a$")
```

--

```{r}
x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
```

*Question:* How to force a regular expression to only match a complete string?

---
# Character classes and alternatives

- `\d` matches any digit

- `\s` matches any whitespace (e.g., space, tab, newline)

- `[abc]` matches a, b, x

- `[^abc]`matches anything except a, b, c

--

```{r}
x <- c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c")
str_view(x, "a[.]c")
str_view(x, ".[*]c")
str_view(x, "a[ ]")
```

- Alternative to backslash escapes when including a single special character.

---
# Character classes and alternatives

- Use *alternation* to pick between one or more alternative patterns

  - Example: `abc|d..f` will match either "abc" or "deaf"
  
- But `abc|xyz` won't match `abcxy` or `abxyz`

- Use parentheses to make it easy to understand

```{r}
str_view(c("grey", "gray"), "gr(e|a)y")
```

--

**Question:** Create regular expression to find all words that

  1. Start with a vowel
  
  2. End with `ed`, but not with `eed`.
  
  3. End with `ing` or `ise`.
